Develop a backend API for an advanced event management system using Node.js
and Express.js.
Requirements:
1. API Endpoints:
Create, update, and delete events with complex nested data (e.g., multiple
sessions, speakers).
Register participants with validation (e.g., limit the number of participants
per event).
Retrieve detailed event reports, including a nested list of sessions and
participants.
2. Database Interaction:
Use TypeORM or Drizzle to manage complex relationships between
events, sessions, and participants.
3. Dependency Injection:
Implement DI for database services, event logic, and PDF generation.
4. PDF Generation:
Generate a PDF report for each event, detailing sessions and registered
participants, with specific formatting requirements.
5. Code Quality:
Use appropriate design patterns
